			<p class="text-justify toptext">SolvePOMDP is a Java program that solves Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The program executes value iteration to find a POMDP solution and writes the solution to a file. The program contains both exact and approximate methods. This webpage contains all the information that is required to use SolvePOMDP, and it provides further references to related scientific literature and online resources.</p>

			<a id="features" class="anchor"></a>
			<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star iconcolor"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Features</h3>
			<p>The SolvePOMDP software contains the following key features:</p>
			<ul id="featurelist">
				<li>Solving POMDPs optimally using incremental pruning (Cassandra, Littman and Zhang 1997) combined with state-of-the-art vector pruning methods (Walraven and Spaan 2017).</li>
				<li>Computing approximate POMDP solutions using randomized point-based value iteration (Spaan and Vlassis 2005).</li>
				<li>The program provides out of the box support for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.</li>
				<li>POMDPs can be defined using Tony's POMDP file format, and the resulting solutions are represented by alpha vectors and policy graphs.</li>
			</ul>

			<a id="download" class="anchor"></a>
			<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt iconcolor"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Download</h3>
			<p>We recommend to use one of the SolvePOMDP packages below, which already include an executable and all necessary files to start the solver. The current version of SolvePOMDP is 0.0.3.</p>

						<p>The zip file contains all the files that are required to get started. The steps below will guide you through the setup and it explains how to run SolvePOMDP.</p>
						<h4>1. Directory structure</h4>
						<p>After extracting the zip archive you will find a <i>domains</i> directory, which includes POMDP descriptions based on <a href="http://pomdp.org/code/pomdp-file-spec.html" target="_blank">Tony's POMDP file format</a>. Your own POMDP domains can be added to this directory. When solving a POMDP model, the solver generates files in the <i>output</i> directory. This can be either in <a href="http://pomdp.org/code/alpha-file-spec.html" target="_blank">value function format</a>, or in <a href="http://pomdp.org/code/pg-file-spec.html" target="_blank">policy graph format</a>. For more details about the file formats and example domains we refer to <a href="http://pomdp.org/" target="_blank">pomdp.org</a>.</p>

						<h4>2. Configuration file</h4>
						<p>The <i>solver.config</i> file allows you to modify a few parameters of the POMDP solver. The documentation in this file explains the parameters and how to set them properly before executing SolvePOMDP. The default configuration should be appropriate in most cases. An important parameter is the algorithm that should be used, which can be either exact or approximate.</p>

						<h4>3. Linear programming solvers</h4>
						<p>POMDP algorithms require a linear programming solver during their execution. SolvePOMDP comes with two built-in linear programming solvers that can be used without any additional configuration. It also supports a commercial linear programming solver.</p>
						<ul class="bulletlist">
							<li>LPSolve (built-in) – A recent version of LPSolve has been included in SolvePOMDP. By default it uses the 32 bits version. If you want to use the 64 bits version, then it is required to modify the <code>run</code> script prior to executing it using a text editor (e.g., Notepad++). The architecture should match the architecture of your Java installation, rather than the operating system.</li>
							<li>JOptimizer (built-in, experimental) – This solver does not require additional configuration and works out of the box, but should be considered experimental. It can be expected that other solvers run much faster. Moreover, due to minor numerical stability problems the resulting output may be slightly different.</li>
							<li>Gurobi – Follow the <a href="http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_windows/software_installation_guid.html" target="_blank">official installation guide</a> to install the solver. If you use a 32 bits Java version, make sure to install the 32 bits Gurobi version (the same applies to a 64 bits architecture). Gurobi includes a .jar library file in the lib subdirectory of the Gurobi installation, which you should copy to the <i>libs</i> directory of SolvePOMDP.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The linear programming solver of your choice can be defined in the configuration file.</p>

						<h4>4. Running SolvePOMDP</h4>
						<p>You can start the POMDP solver by executing <code>run partpainting.POMDP</code>, in which the filename refers to a domain description file in the <i>domains</i> directory. You may need to change the permissions of the files before executing the commands. The output should be similar to the following example:</p>
